<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


A calculator is a device or software application that is used to perform mathematical calculations. It can be a hand-held device, a desktop device, or a software application that runs on a computer or mobile device. Calculators come in a wide range of sizes, designs, and capabilities, from basic models with simple arithmetic capabilities to advanced models with scientific, statistical, and programming functions.

In summary, a calculator is a device or software application that is used to perform mathematical calculations. It can be used by students, professionals, researchers, engineers, and anyone who needs to perform mathematical calculations. The uses of calculators vary from basic arithmetic calculations to advanced mathematical and programming calculations, and can be used in a variety of settings and for different purposes.



<h2>Information on JAVA and Apache NET BEANS</h2>

* Java is a programming language that is widely used for creating desktop applications, mobile apps, web applications, and other types of software. Java is known for its portability, meaning that code written in Java can run on a wide variety of platforms without modification.

* Apache NetBeans is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is used for developing Java applications. It is built on top of the Java platform and provides a wide range of features for writing, debugging, and testing Java code. Some of the features include a code editor, a visual layout editor, and integrated debugging and testing tools.

* When used together, Java and Apache NetBeans provide a powerful toolset for developing Java applications. Java can be used to write the code for the application, while Apache NetBeans can be used to edit, debug, and test the code. Additionally, Apache NetBeans provides a wide range of tools and features that can help to streamline the development process and make it easier to create high-quality Java applications.

* Apache NetBeans also support other languages and frameworks such as C/C++, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and others.

* In summary, Java and Apache NetBeans are two tools that are commonly used together in software development, with Java providing the programming language and Apache NetBeans providing the development environment. Together, they provide a powerful toolset for developing high-quality Java applications with ease.

<h2> Calculator App made with JAVA and Apache Net Beans</h2>

Creating a calculator using Java and Apache NetBeans. Here are the general steps that would be involved in creating such a calculator:

* 1. Create a new Java project in Apache NetBeans. This can be done by selecting "File" -> "New Project" and choosing "Java Application" as the project type.

* 2. Create the GUI for the calculator. This can be done by using a layout manager, such as BorderLayout or GridLayout, to arrange buttons and labels on the screen. The buttons would represent the digits and mathematical operators, while the labels would be used to display the input and output of the calculator.

* 3. Implement the event handlers for the buttons. These handlers would be responsible for updating the calculator's state and displaying the results when a button is clicked.

* 4. Implement the mathematical logic for the calculator. This would involve writing code to perform the calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* 5. Test the calculator thoroughly and fix any bugs that are found.

* 6. Package and distribute the calculator.

It's worth noting that this is a general overview of the steps involved in creating a calculator using Java and Apache NetBeans, and the actual implementation would depend on your specific requirements, and also your programming skills.

Apache NetBeans offers a lot of features that can help you in the development process such as code completion, debugging, and testing, it also provides a visual layout editor that can help you to create the calculator's UI faster, and also offers a lot of libraries and frameworks that can help you in the development process.

It's also possible to create a more advanced calculator, with scientific or programming capabilities, depending on the requirements and the knowledge of the developer.
